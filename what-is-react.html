          <p>
            React has a few different kinds of components, but we’ll start with React.Component subclasses:
          </p>
          <pre class="scroll">
            class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
              render() {
                return (
                  &lt;div className="shopping-list"&gt;
                    &lt;h1&gt;Shopping List for {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;ul&gt;
                      &lt;li&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
                      &lt;li&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/li&gt;
                      &lt;li&gt;Oculus&lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &lt;/div&gt;
                );
              }
            }
            
            // Example usage: &lt;ShoppingList name="Mark" /&gt;
          </pre>
          <p>
          We’ll get to the funny XML-like tags soon.
          We use components to tell React what we want to see on the screen.\
            When our data changes, React will efficiently update and re-render our components.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, ShoppingList is a <strong>React component class</strong>, or <strong>React component type</strong>.
            A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.
          </p>
          <p>
            The render method returns a description of what you want to see on the screen. React takes the description and displays the result.
            In particular, render returns a <strong>React element</strong>, which is a lightweight description of what to render.
            Most React ""developers use a special syntax called “JSX” which makes these structures easier to write. The &lt;div /&gt; syntax is transformed at build time to React.createElement('div'). The example above is equivalent to:
          </p>
          <pre class="scroll">
            return React.createElement('div', {className: 'shopping-list'},
              React.createElement('h1', /* ... h1 children ... */),
              React.createElement('ul', /* ... ul children ... */)
            );
          </pre>
          <p>
            <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/#?presets=react&code_lz=DwEwlgbgBAxgNgQwM5IHII…4cuwAK5wTXbg1YBJSswTV5mQ7c7XgtgOqEETEgAguTuYFamtgDyMBZmSGFWhhYchuAQrADc7EA" target="_blank">See full expanded version</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re curious, createElement() is described in more detail in the API reference, but we won’t be using it in this tutorial.
            Instead, we will keep using JSX.
          </p>
          <p>
            JSX comes with the full power of JavaScript. You can put <em>any</em> JavaScript expressions within braces inside JSX.
            Each React element is a JavaScript object that you can store in a variable or pass around in your program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ShoppingList component above only renders built-in DOM components like &lt;div /&gt; and &lt;li /&gt;.
            But you can compose and render custom React components too. For example, we can now refer to the whole shopping list by writing &lt;ShoppingList /&gt;.
            Each React component is encapsulated and can operate independently; this allows you to build complex UIs from simple components.
